# Milestone 1: Project Setup and Landing Page

This guide provides a high-level approach for implementing Milestone 1 of the Crime Prediction Chatbot frontend development plan, focusing on setting up the project structure and creating an engaging landing page.

## Goals for Milestone 1

- Set up a React project with JavaScript
- Create the basic application structure
- Implement a compelling landing page
- Set up routing for navigation
- Establish the styling system with Tailwind CSS

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Initialize React Project

1. **Create a new React application** using Create React App, which provides a solid foundation with a pre-configured build setup.

2. **Clean up the initial project structure** by removing unnecessary files and boilerplate code to start with a clean slate.

3. **Install essential dependencies**:
   - React Router for navigation between pages
   - A UI component library (Material UI or Chakra UI) for pre-built components
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

4. **Configure Tailwind CSS**:
   - Initialize Tailwind configuration
   - Define a custom color palette that aligns with the application's theme (safety, risk levels)
   - Set up custom utility classes for common UI patterns

### Step 2: Create Folder Structure

Establish a well-organized folder structure that follows the plan outlined in the frontend development document:

- **Components**: Organized by feature (Auth, Chat, Map, common)
- **Pages**: Separate directories for Landing, Chatbot, and Auth pages
- **Services**: For API communication
- **Context**: For state management
- **Utils**: For helper functions
- **Styles**: For global styling

This structure promotes maintainability and separation of concerns as the application grows.

## File Structure

By the end of Milestone 1, your project should have the following file structure:

```
frontend/
├── public/                     # Static files
│   ├── index.html              # HTML entry point

│   │   │   └── LandingPage.js  # Landing page component
│   │   │
│   │   ├── Chatbot/            # Chatbot page
│   │   │   └── ChatbotPage.js  # Placeholder chatbot page
│   │   │
│   │   └── Auth/               # Authentication pages
│   │       ├── LoginPage.js    # Placeholder login page
│   │       └── SignupPage.js   # Placeholder signup page
│   │
│   ├── services/               # API and service integrations (empty for now)
│   │   └── .gitkeep            # File to maintain empty directory in git
│   │
│   ├── context/                # Context providers (empty for now)
│   │   └── .gitkeep            # File to maintain empty directory in git
│   │
│   ├── hooks/                  # Custom React hooks (empty for now)
│   │   └── .gitkeep            # File to maintain empty directory in git
│   │
│   ├── utils/                  # Helper functions (empty for now)
│   │   └── .gitkeep            # File to maintain empty directory in git
│   │
│   ├── styles/                 # Global styles
│   │   └── globals.css         # Global CSS customizations
│   │
│   ├── App.js                  # Main application component with routes
│   ├── index.js                # Application entry point
│   └── index.css               # Main CSS with Tailwind directives
│
├── package.json                # Project dependencies and scripts
├── tailwind.config.js          # Tailwind CSS configuration
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

This file structure organizes the application in a way that makes it easy to locate and modify components, separates concerns, and follows React best practices. Empty placeholder directories are included to maintain the intended structure and prepare for future implementation.

### Step 3: Set Up Routing

Implement basic routing using React Router with routes for:
- Landing page (home route)
- Chatbot page
- Login page
- Signup page

Configure the router to handle navigation between these pages, ensuring a smooth user experience with proper history management.

### Step 4: Create Basic Layout Components

Develop reusable layout components that will be shared across multiple pages:

1. **Header Component**:
   - Logo and branding
   - Navigation links
   - Authentication buttons
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

2. **Footer Component**:
   - Company information
   - Navigation links
   - Legal links (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)
   - Copyright information

3. **Layout Component**:
   - Wrapper that combines Header and Footer
   - Container for page content
   - Ensures consistent layout across pages

### Step 5: Design and Implement Landing Page

Create an engaging landing page that effectively communicates the value proposition:

1. **Hero Section**:
   - Compelling headline about crime prediction and safety
   - Subheading that explains the core functionality
   - Call-to-action buttons (Try Chatbot, Create Account)
   - Visually appealing illustration or image

2. **Features Section**:
   - Grid of key features with icons
   - Brief descriptions of how the app works:
     - Location specification
     - Time selection
     - Risk assessment

3. **Call to Action Section**:
   - Final encouragement to start using the chatbot
   - Prominent button directing to the chatbot page

Ensure the landing page is visually appealing, clearly communicates the value proposition, and guides users toward the main functionality.

### Step 6: Create Empty Placeholder Pages

For features that will be implemented in future milestones, create simple placeholder pages:

1. **Chatbot Page**:
   - Basic structure with a heading
   - Placeholder message indicating future implementation
   - Consistent with the overall design

2. **Login Page**:
   - Page structure and layout
   - Message indicating implementation in Milestone 2
   - Link to the signup page

3. **Signup Page**:
   - Page structure and layout
   - Message indicating implementation in Milestone 2
   - Link to the login page

These placeholder pages maintain a consistent user experience while clearly indicating which features are coming soon.

### Step 7: Implement Responsive Design

Ensure the application is fully responsive across different screen sizes:

1. **Mobile-First Approach**:
   - Design for small screens first
   - Add breakpoints for larger screens
   - Utilize Tailwind's responsive utility classes

2. **Responsive Navigation**:
   - Hamburger menu for mobile devices
   - Expanded navigation for desktop
   - Proper spacing and sizing across devices

3. **Flexible Layouts**:
   - Grid and flexbox for responsive content organization
   - Proper image handling for different screen sizes
   - Readable typography at all breakpoints

### Step 8: Testing and Refinement

Before completing Milestone 1, thoroughly test the implementation:

1. **Browser Testing**:
   - Verify functionality across different browsers
   - Test on multiple screen sizes
   - Check for any layout issues or visual bugs

2. **Navigation Testing**:
   - Confirm all routes work correctly
   - Verify navigation between pages
   - Test browser history navigation

3. **Visual Refinement**:
   - Ensure consistent spacing and alignment
   - Check for visual consistency with the design vision
   - Optimize any performance issues

## What's Next

After completing Milestone 1, you'll have:

- A fully functional landing page that showcases the application
- Basic application structure ready for expansion
- Navigation between pages set up
- A consistent visual design language
- Placeholder pages for features coming in subsequent milestones

In Milestone 2, you'll build on this foundation to implement the authentication system with login and signup functionality.

## Key Considerations

- **Performance**: Keep the initial load time fast by minimizing unnecessary dependencies
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the landing page is accessible to all users
- **SEO**: Use proper semantic HTML for better search engine visibility
- **Design Consistency**: Maintain a consistent look and feel across all components
- **Code Organization**: Set a clear pattern for component structure that will scale as the app grows
